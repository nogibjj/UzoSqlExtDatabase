# Purpose
This purpose of this lab was to setup code that will take a csv file, create a SQL database, and utilize DataBricks as an environment to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Operations. This library was utilized to make performing CRUD Operations with the database all through the command line, giving the project a CLI. Command line interfaces are important for the use of easy to use and integrate SQL into python and utilize it seamlessly. SQL will be utiltized for this process and the database will be loaded directly onto Databricks servers.  

Tasks Performed
Create SQL Database
Write code to utilize SQLite for query execution
Wrap main.py execution with Fire library to convert code into CLI
Write up different CRUD SQL Queries to test functionality
Test connection

#### With the use of command line tools and SQL we were able to create a University of Georgia offers and commits table , load them onto a database on DataBricks compatible with SQL and with the use of the read_data CL tool we were able to create a query. Using C.R.U.D we can make changes to our Database if need be.
